# Place trajectories (.gro) and structure (.xtc) files in Trajectories
# Run BS_master_sort.py
# This script will create a Trials folder inside Trajectories (make sure a folder by that name doesn't exist in it).
# N_trial number of empty folders will be created inside the Trials directory
# Inside Trajectories/Trials/ a .val file will be created for each taxon with N_trial number of uniformly distributed 
# random numbers between 0 and 10,000. If the trajectory has nmore than 10,000 frames adjust the number in line 32 accordingly. 
# The script will also run BS_slave.tcl through vmd - which will for each .gro file extract the N_trial conformations 
# indicated by the numbers in .val for each taxon and place it in the appropriate trial_# folder. 


# Now run BS_secondary_run.py
# It will count the number of cores, and leaving one free, set up the job/shell files. 
# if N_trials = 100 and 10 cores are available for usage then 10 shell files will be created - each with ten sets of the following
#
# 1) cd Trajectories/Trial/trial_#      	// Enter a trial folder
# 2) ./run_superpose_pair_directly.py 		// do all by all comparison
# 3) ./qPairs2list.py				// parse comparison results to list scores
# 4) ./Qscore_2_Mx.py				// converts scores to matrix form
# 5) ./Mx2nj.py					// convert matrix to a phylogenetic tree
# 
# The shell files will help automate the routine.
# Once all jobs are completes, a tree file will be present in each trail folder. 
# Collect all of them to an appropriate location (X). 
#
# Generate a reference tree
# 
# Copy the reference PDB to Reference directory
# Run the script s1.py which should 
# run all the scripts in proper order. 
# 
# A reference tree file will be created. Move this tree to location above (X).


# Now using sumtrees, use trial trees to sum statistics on the reference tree. 
# Note that the taxon names should be identical between all trials and the reference. 
# sumtrees.py -d0 -p -o OutputTree -t ReferenceTree *.nex
# where OutputTree is the name of the output tree created with support values
# ReferenceTree is the tree for which the support values are calculated
# *.nex --- this short hand can be used instead of explicitly listing each tree. Please note that location X should 
# have only a reference tree with a suffix other then nex e.g. Ref.tree and the 100 trial trees which have the suffix .nex. 
The OutputTree can now be visualised using any standard tree visualisation program e.g. SplitsTree (for tree / network) or Figtree.
